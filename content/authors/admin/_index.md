Dr. Luke Whiley is an analytical biochemist with over ten years of experience in metabolomics and small molecule bioanalysis, working across both academic and industrial laboratories. Luke is currently a Senior Lecturer (Research) in Phenomics at the Australian National Phenome Centre (ANPC) and the Health Futures Research institute at Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia. 

Luke's research specialises in the development and application of novel analytical approaches that are optimised to investigate the metabolic processes that underpin neurodegenerative conditions. By doing so, Luke's work seeks to uncover clues into how and why it s only certain individuals who are more susceptible to neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline, whilst others maintain cognitive health as they age. 

To achieve this, Luke and his research team utilise analytical chemistry technologies (mass spectrometry - MS; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy - NMR) to measure the metabolic content of biological samples (urine and blood).  From these data, the team can  generate unique chemical signatures that are associate with neurodegeneration, giving insight into the metabolic interactions that occur between genetics, lifestyle and environment throughout a persons life that may influence the development of neurodegenerative conditions and declines in cognition.


Luke also has a deep interest in developing the state of the art analytical capabilities of the ANPC and advancing the analytical chemistry that underpins the acquisition and processing of phenotyping data. Luke's work in this space focuses on ensuring that analytical methods are robust and reliable and can be deployed in large-scale epidemiology and clinical studies in order to generate high-quality population wide phenotypic data.

Previously, Luke’s research in metabolomics has taken him to positions at the UK National Phenome Centre and the UK Dementia Research Institute (both Imperial College London) before arriving at Murdoch in October 2019. In addition, Luke has held industrial analytical chemistry positions at the UK anti-doping laboratory, including time at the Olympic Games drug testing facility, as well as working for the UK Ministry of Defence as a mass spectrometry specialist.

Luke also is active in outreach and the communication of metabolomics and healthy ageing research to the public, and has been involved with then national Pint of Science festival, social media campaigns for dementia charities, appeared on ABC Perth Radio, and the Naked Scientist and Avid Research Podcasts.
